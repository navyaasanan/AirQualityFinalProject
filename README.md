NIKITA AND NAVYAA'S FINAL PROJECT FOR CS 125

This project will be an air quality app made in Android Studio. We will return air quality indexes (AQIs) along with personalized recommendations, as well as the option to get information tailored for people with specific conditions (asthma, pregnancy) and specific age groups (children, the elderly) that could increase risk.

API we plan to use : https://docs.breezometer.com/api-documentation/air-quality-api/v2/#request-parameters
Challenges:
1. API requires latitude and longitudes for requests - will need to connect that to cities somehow
2. Can we use a GPS feature or should we pick a few big cities to take data from?
