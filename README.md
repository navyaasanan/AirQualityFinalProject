# AirQualityFinalProject
Nikita and Navyaa's final Project

This will be an app that will take information from an air quality API and return the severity of the pollution, specific pollutants in higher quantities, some recommendations and precautions, as well as specific information based on particular fields such as potential conditions that could affect risk (asthma, pregnancy) and age (children and the elderly).

API we're interested in using : https://docs.breezometer.com/api-documentation/air-quality-api/v2/#response-data-fields

Challenges:
1. API needs latitude and longitude values for call request
2. How many cities should we do
