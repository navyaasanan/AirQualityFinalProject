NIKITA AGARWAL AND NAVYAA SANAN'S FINAL PROJECT FOR CS 125 - FALL 2018

This project is an attempt at an air quality app made in Android Studio. We intended to return air quality indexes (AQIs) along with personalized recommendations, as well as the option to get information tailored for people with specific conditions (asthma, pregnancy) and specific age groups (children, the elderly) that could increase risk.

API we planned to use : https://docs.breezometer.com/api-documentation/air-quality-api/v2/#request-parameters
